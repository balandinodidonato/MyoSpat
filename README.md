# MyoSpat
MyoSpat is an interactive system that empowers musicians to control and transform  sound, visual and lighting effects through an emabodied gestural interaction.
It uses the Myo armband as input device, a quadraphonic audio system to render the sound, and an [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3) coupled with Tinkerkit DMXMaster Shield to then control four DMX controlled RGBW 3W LEDs lights. MyoSpat Audiovisual engine was developed using [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/).
